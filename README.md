## Intro
How many separate apps do you use in your day? From personal apps to social, scheduling to managing photos, videos, etc., Chronicles is a Desktop application aimed at bringing ALL of those to one place (the scope of this project only covers registration/login, homepage, and journal posts with CRUD capabilities).


## Overview
Chronicle is an app that currently allows every user to:
1. Register a new account.
2. Login.
3. Navigate between Home page, Journal, and Journal Entries (Quill).
4. Create, Edit, and Delete new and existing journal entries, as well as search all entries by keyword.
5. Logout.

Version 2.0+
1.	Manage, organize, and record every moment of their life via journal entries, digital media, email & calendar syncronization, etc.
2.	See the current date and weather on the homepage.
3.	Customize the appearance of the app (background images, color-scheme, etc.) to their own personal liking.
4.	Upload photos, video, etc. via the Media section.
5.	Sync social media apps to one place via the Social page.
6.	Catalogue life's many adventures in a unique, personalized, and intuitive way via the Adventures section.
7.	Set personal goals and record achievements in the Goals & Achievements section.
Each user can navigate each section of the app seamlessly via the navigation bar fixed at the top of each page.  There is also a settings icon that allows the user to customize their app/experience.


## Project Goals
My MVP (minimum viable product) goals for this project were to accomplish the following:

* User login/registration.
* Create and esthetically pleasing design.
* User-specific CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) as it relates to journal entries. 
* Search journal entries by keyword. 
* Logout.
